# Dorks Eye v2.0
**Google Hacking Dork Scraping and Searching Script - Now with 5 Search Engines**

Dorks Eye is a script I made in Python 3. With this tool, you can easily find Google Dorks. Dorks Eye collects potentially vulnerable web pages and applications on the Internet or other interesting info that search engines pick up.

## Why this major update v2.0?

Google doesn't like automated searches anymore. They started blocking them more aggressively. That's annoying.

So I added 4 more search engines:

* **DuckDuckGo** - Reliable, privacy-focused
* **Bing** - Fast and reliable  
* **Google** - Still there (Often blocked due to bot detection (YMMV)
* **Brave Search** - Privacy-focused, independent
* **Yandex** - Different results, reliable

Yes, it's called "Google Dorking" but dorks work on any search engine. When Google blocks you, switch engines. Keep searching. Simple as that.

You can save the output in a file. You decide how many results you want.

Dorks Eye shows only the links, no ads, and it's fast.

But be careful. Too many requests in a short time = captchas or IP blocks. That's why having 5 engines helps.

## Install Dorks Eye

A prerequisite for scripts I make is that they must be simple and easy to use for everyone.

Dorks Eye has been tested on:
* Kali Linux
* Parrot Security OS
* BlackArch
* Termux

This list will be expanded.

****

Dorks Eye is written for Python 3. Clone the git repository and install the requirements.

# Installing Dorks Eye in a Virtual Environment

Recent changes in Parrot OS and Kali Linux require Dorks Eye to be installed in an isolated Python environment to avoid dependency conflicts. Follow these steps:

## Installation Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BullsEye0/dorks-eye.git
cd dorks-eye
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

****

# How to use Dorks Eye

```bash
python3 dorks-eye.py
```

You'll be asked to choose your search engine (1-6), or select option 6 to search ALL engines at once.

To deactivate the virtual environment when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

That's all!  
Have fun üòÉ

****

# Termux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BullsEye0/dorks-eye.git
cd dorks-eye
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage Termux

```bash
python dorks-eye.py
```
